# Knowledge-Guided Learning for Gas Turbine Dynamics

This project demonstrates a **Knowledge-Guided Learning (KGL)** approach for modeling the temporal dynamics of gas turbines. The framework incorporates **domain knowledge** into the learning process using multi-state constraints, enhancing prediction accuracy and physical consistency compared to traditional deep learning models.

## Overview

### Objective

To predict the electrical power generated by a gas turbine based on input control signals while ensuring predictions align with real-world dynamics:

1. **Baseline Model**: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers.
2. **Knowledge-Guided Model**: Extends the baseline by adding domain knowledge through a custom multi-state constraint loss.

## Features

- Implements **Baseline** and **Knowledge-Guided Models**.
- Integrates **multi-state constraints** in loss functions for smooth and consistent predictions.
- Provides utilities to:
  - Preprocess time-series data.
  - Train models and evaluate performance.
  - Visualize results (loss curves, predictions vs ground truth).
- Demonstrates improved data efficiency and generalization.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of time-series data collected from a micro gas turbine and contains:

- **Columns**:
  - `time` (float64): Time steps.
  - `input_voltage` (int64): Control signal input.
  - `el_power` (float64): Electrical power output.
- **Files**:
  - `ex_1.csv` and `ex_9.csv` are used to combine training and testing data.
